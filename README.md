# odin-recipes
This is the first project that in The Odin Project, which is to make recipes using only HTML.

My Thought:
It was a very exciting experience for a person like me who never code before prior to this. This first project did'nt necessary hard but I find myself going back and forth checking and looking at syntax that I have leaned before but already forgot. I think this project helps me tremendously in making those syntax stick as well as how git and github works. I try to commit everytime I'm making a new changes in the file and feel that I really need to understand and mastering how to do commit properly. Lastly, it was very fun! Excited for the next lesson on CSS.
