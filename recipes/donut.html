    <h1>Cornbread Donut Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/donut.jpg">
    <p>Chef John's cornbread donuts are baked, not fried. They're slightly sweet and drizzled with a spicy chipotle icing. Barely more effort than whipping up a batch of cornbread, this will be your new favorite donut, and a novel, fun dessert to serve at your next barbecue.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Donut Batter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Spicy Chipotle Icing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup confectioners sugar, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously butter 2 nonstick donut pans (6 compartments per pan).</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add egg and sugar to a large bowl; whisk until mixture turns a pale yellow, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Whisk in melted butter until combined, then whisk in milk and buttermilk. Add cornmeal mixture and whisk until a thick, sticky batter forms, 2 to 3 minutes, to develop a little bit of gluten so donuts are not overly fragile after baking.</li>
        <li>Spoon or pipe batter evenly into prepared pans, for 12 donuts total. Tap pans on the counter a few times to settle the batter down. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden on the top and a toothpick inserted in the thickest part comes out clean, about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let cool for 10 minutes; remove donuts from pans to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Whisk confectioner&rsquo;s sugar, lemon juice, milk, and chipotle together in a small bowl until very thick and smooth. Add confectioner&rsquo;s sugar, a small amount at a time, to form an icing thick enough to hold its shape when piped.</li>
        <li>Pipe or spread icing as desired over donuts. Let icing set until firm, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
